# Project Architecture and Design Patterns

The project follows several design patterns and architecture principles to ensure code organization, scalability, and maintainability. Below is an overview of the key design patterns and architecture used:

## 1. **MVC Architecture (Model-View-Controller)**

The project follows the **MVC** (Model-View-Controller) architecture, which separates the application logic into three main components:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic. It is responsible for manipulating data, such as accessing databases or performing calculations. In the project, models are located in the `models/` folder.
  
- **View**: Represents the user interface (UI). In this case, it consists of Tkinter components. The view is responsible for displaying data to the user and receiving user inputs. In the project, views are found in the `views/` folder.

- **Controller**: Manages the interaction between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the view, processes it (possibly with the help of the model), and updates the view accordingly. In the project, controllers are located in the `controllers/` folder.

**Advantages of the MVC Pattern:**
- **Decoupling**: Each component (Model, View, and Controller) is decoupled, making it easier to maintain and extend the application.
- **Testability**: It is easy to test models and controllers in isolation.
- **Scalability**: New views or controllers can be added without affecting other parts of the system.

## 2. **Repository Pattern**

The **Repository Pattern** is used to manage interactions with data sources (e.g., databases, files). Repositories provide an abstraction for accessing data, allowing changes in the data source implementation without affecting the rest of the application.

- Repositories are found in the `repositories/` folder and are responsible for performing data read and write operations.
  
**Advantages of the Repository Pattern:**
- **Abstraction**: It allows the application logic to be decoupled from data access details.
- **Centralization**: All data access is centralized in the repositories, making it easier to maintain.

## 3. **Dependency Management Pattern**

The **Dependency Management Pattern** may be implicitly used in the project, particularly in the `managers/` folder. This pattern is useful for managing dependencies between different components (e.g., between views, models, and controllers), especially in large and complex applications.

**Advantages of the Dependency Management Pattern:**
- **Decoupling**: It enables components to communicate without being directly coupled.
- **Flexibility**: It facilitates changing or configuring dependencies without modifying the components’ code.

## 4. **Dependency Injection Pattern**

Although not explicitly mentioned, the **Dependency Injection Pattern** might be used implicitly through the project structure, especially in the `managers/` folder. This pattern allows objects or components to receive their dependencies from an external source (instead of creating their own instances), improving flexibility and testability.

**Advantages of the Dependency Injection Pattern:**
- **Decoupling**: Components don’t have to worry about creating their dependencies.
- **Testability**: It makes it easier to substitute dependencies with mock versions for testing.

### Explanation of Files and Directories

- **`assets/`**: Contains images, icons, and other media resources used in the application (e.g., logo, icons).
  
- **`app/`**: Contains the core of the application, including:
  - **`controllers/`**: The logic that controls data flow between the model and view.
  - **`models/`**: Defines data models representing the structure of the application’s data.
  - **`repositories/`**: Manages interactions with data sources (e.g., databases or external files).
  - **`views/`**: Contains the Tkinter-based UI components.
  - **`managers/`**: Handles various other concerns, such as dependency management or view-related tasks.

- **`tests/`**: Includes unit tests for the application.
  - **`test_app.py`**: Tests for the initialization and core logic of the application.
  - **`test_views.py`**: Tests for the user interface (Tkinter views).
  - **`test_controllers.py`**: Tests for the controller logic and data flow.
  - **`test_repositories.py`**: Tests for data access logic.

- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore (e.g., virtual environments, temporary files, etc.).

- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and general information.

- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies needed to run the application.

- **`main.py`**: The entry point for running the application. This file initializes and starts the app.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_directory>

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. Run the application:
   
    ```bash
   python main.py
   
Dependencies

- tkinter for the GUI
- customtkinter for enhanced tkinter widgets
- Other Python packages listed in requirements.txt
